          Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Paul a Software Writer based in Dorest. I enjoy mastering
          Vim, tinkering with my homelab using Kubernetes. Main language of
          choice is Python and SQL, while learning Go at the moment. Currently a
          Lead Solution Engineer in AdTech. I like to keep track of things I
          learn in my TIL repo, I often find myself looking through this as a
          refresher.

    </Layout>
